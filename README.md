### NOTE: VUüêìonly works with macOS, iOS and iCloud calendars, as these are currently the only full-featured implementations of the iCal standard. The script needs tweaks and workarounds to get working on the other platforms. Feel free to fork the repo and do so.

# Timetable Extractor for VU Rooster

This bookmarklet allows you to extract the course schedule information from VU Amsterdam's legacy Rooster web app and export them in iCal format, appropriate for importing in ordinary calendar applications.

Please note that the code is under _beta test_, so use it at your risk.

Also note that due to a deficiency in the way [RFC 5545](https://icalendar.org/RFC-Specifications/iCalendar-RFC-5545/) and [RFC 7986](https://icalendar.org/RFC-Specifications/New-Properties-for-iCalendar-RFC-7986/) have been implemented in Microsoft Outlook, the current solution won't work properly on that platform. Subsequent developments will fix this issue.
